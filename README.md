# Assignmet 1

It was an assignment I did two years ago.

I received a description of a level layout and game rules.

A player can shoot and double jump. 

A key is shown after all enemies are killed

The player can exit a level using the door after taking a key.

I have used ProBuilder to create a level.

The game uses the new input system for player input and supports a keyboard and a gamepad.

Settings use scriptable objects, making it easy to change things like bullet settings, player movement 
settings etc.

Rules have custom gizmos drawn when selected to visualise elements that are part of a rule.

Kill rule:
